### CS 145 Project: README

This program is written in Python 3.
In order to run it properly, please input the following in an Ubuntu terminal:

`python3 sender.py [ -f 881967a8.txt -a 10.0.7.141 -s 9000 -c 6670 -i 881967a8 ]`

Running `python3 sender.py` is necessary to make it work, but the flags in the brackets are optional.
The -f, -c, and -i flags in this example are the default values which were provided to me via email.
The -a and -s flags in this example are the default values provided in the project specifications.

For more information about the flags, please refer to the project specifications.
